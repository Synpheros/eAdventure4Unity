@inproceedings{Torrente2010,
	abstract = {Within the last years educational games have attracted some attention from the academic community. Multiple enhancements of the learning experience are usually attributed to educational games, although the most cited is their potential to improve students' motivation. In spite of these expected advantages, how to introduce video games in the learning process is an issue that is not completely clear yet, which reduces the potential impact of educational video games. Our goal at the {\textless};e-UCM{\textgreater} research group is to identify the barriers that are limiting the integration of games in the learning process and propose approaches to tackle them. The result of this work is the {\textless};e-Adventure{\textgreater} platform, an educational game authoring tool that aims to make of video games just another educational tool at the disposal of the instructors. In this paper we describe how {\textless};e-Adventure{\textgreater} contributes to the integration of games in the learning process through three main focuses: reduction of the high development costs of educational games, involvement of instructors in the development process to enhance the educational value, and the production of the games using a white-box model. In addition we describe the current research that we are conducting using the platform as a test-bed.},

@article{Report2009,
	abstract = {Android is an open source complete software stack (that includes operating system, Linux kernel, middleware and some useful applications) for mobile platforms; pro- posed by Open Handset Alliance, a global alliance of leading technology and mobile industries. Android platform has its own virtual machine dalvik. Every Android application runs in its own process, with its own instance of the Dalvik virtual machine. Dalvik has been written so that a device can run multiple instances of the VM eciently. The Dalvik VM executes les in the Dalvik Executable (.dex) format which is optimized for minimal memory footprint. The VM is register-based, and runs classes compiled by a Java language compiler that have been transformed into the .dex format by the included dx tool. The Dalvik VM relies on the Linux kernel for underlying functionalities such as threading and low-level memory management. In this report we have discussed virtual machines, specically Dalvik virtual ma- chine in detail and their runtime libraries in comparison with JVM's libraries. The report answers questions, such as why Dalvik was needed and how it overcomes the deciencies of its counterpart Java virtual machine. Moreover, this report also gathers some statistics related to the Android and iPhone market place. Most of comparative statistics suggest that Android is still far be- hind iPhone in the consumer market, both in terms of revenue generation and size captured. However, it is also evident how quickly Android has advanced in market to its current size of 7000 applications and almost 3000 publishers. Android new projects increased to almost doubled the number in just one month i.e., 325 projects in September to 625 in October.},

@article{Reina2012,
	abstract = {Localization, and in particular translation, is a key aspect of modern end-user software applications. Open source systems have traditionally taken advantage of distributed and volunteer collaboration to carry localization tasks. In this paper, we will analyze the Android source code repository to know how localization and translation is managed: who participates in this kind of tasks, if the translation workflows, participants and processes follow the same patterns as the rest of the development, and if the Android project takes benefit from external contributions. Our results show that Android should ease the localization tasks to benefit from external contributions. Steps towards obtaining a specialized team as found in many other free software projects are also encouraged. 2012 IEEE.},
